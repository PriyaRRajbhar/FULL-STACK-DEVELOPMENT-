This project is part of my developer training where I build multiple websites folder-by-folder to improve my:

frontend foundations

design thinking

GitHub consistency streak

portfolio building

real development habits

Each project teaches me new concepts that will help me move toward JavaScript, animations, React, and eventually the MERN stack.
